# **mylinear**

`mylinear` is an R package that provides a simple yet efficient implementation of a linear regression model. It is designed as a lightweight tool for educational purposes and for users who want to understand the fundamentals of linear regression modeling in R.

---

## **Features**

- **Custom Linear Regression Function**: Offers the `linear_regression()` function to calculate the slope, intercept, and predictions for a given dataset.
- **Performance**: Lightweight implementation with faster execution and lower memory usage compared to R's built-in `lm()` function.
- **Educational Tool**: Includes a vignette explaining the core concepts of linear regression and how the package works.
- **Benchmarking and Visualization**: Compare `linear_regression()` with R's `lm()` using included examples and visualizations.

## **Installation**

To install `mylinear` from GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Install the `devtools` package if you havenâ€™t already:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

2. Install mylinear directly from GitHub:
```r
devtools::install_github("miaowyyy/mylinear")
```

## **Load the package**
```r
library(mylinear)
```

## **Usage**
For a detailed guide, examples, and explanation of the package, view the vignette:
```r
browseVignettes("mylinear")
```


## **Unit Testing**

The `mylinear` package includes unit tests implemented via the `testthat` framework to ensure the correctness and reliability of its functions. These tests verify:

- Correctness of computed coefficients for known datasets.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., unequal vector lengths).
- Edge cases such as constant response values.

To run the tests:
```R
devtools::test()
```
